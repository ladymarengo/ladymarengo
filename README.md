Hi! I'm a Hive Helsinki student. I am learning C in Hive, coding in Rust and C++ in my free time and also I have some Python experience.

I like to make games in my free time because it's a nice way to learn new things and polish existing skills while having fun. During various game jams and other projects I've tried different languages (Rust, C++, C, Javascript) and collaborated with interesting people. Also I practiced art skills from my previous education by creating almost all assets. Here is a couple of these games:

- [Crazy Cats](https://github.com/ladymarengo/ludum-dare-50) solo for Ludum Dare 50 in Rust.
- [Minesweeper](https://github.com/ladymarengo/biocareerman-2) solo classic game implementation in C++ with SDL
- [BioCareerMan2](https://github.com/ladymarengo/biocareerman-2) team project in Rust for the 2nd Hive Helsinki Game Jam
- [No Way Out?](https://github.com/IanGaplichnik/GameJam) collab with my Hive teammates in JS for Hive Helsinki Game Jam.
- [Brave Crab](https://github.com/ladymarengo/bevy-game-jam) collab with my friends in Rust for the Bevy Game Jam.

I have also completed two [AdventOfCode](https://github.com/ladymarengo/advent-of-code) years in a row, one with Python and one with Rust. These challenges are well-balanced and create a perfect opportunity to learn a new language or find new tricks for the one you already use. They also require a lot of determination and I'm proud of finishing them two times.

I can be very productive working solo but almost always prefer working in a team. Pair-programming sessions motivate me and increase my productivity. In Hive Helsinki school we have both solo and team projects so I had an opportunity to develop corresponding soft-skills.
