Hi! I'm a Hive Helsinki student. I am learning C in Hive, coding in Rust in my free time and also I have some Python experience.

I have completed two [AdventOfCode](https://github.com/ladymarengo/advent-of-code) years in a row, one with Python and one with Rust.

Making games in my free time is something I enjoy, here's a couple of them. In these I've also made all the art except the backgrounds in Brave Crab:

- [Crazy Cats](https://github.com/ladymarengo/ludum-dare-50) solo for Ludum Dare 50 in Rust.
- [No Way Out?](https://github.com/IanGaplichnik/GameJam) collab with my Hive teammates in JS for Hive Helsinki Game Jam.
- [Brave Crab](https://github.com/ladymarengo/bevy-game-jam) collab with my friends in Rust for the Bevy Game Jam.

I like participating in other team activities too, for example making an [AI agent](https://github.com/teemu-hakala/hive-arena-team-aleph) for [Hive Arena](https://github.com/hivehelsinki/hive-arena).

You can find some other various school projects in my [repositories](https://github.com/ladymarengo?tab=repositories)
